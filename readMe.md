this is scrape website using selenium, it is a great tool.

Youtube uses a chanel wich the content is staticlly loaded, add a school feature and will continuie to harvest more data, just need to use a sleep feature aftwords for a 2 seconds to allow the computer to read the data on the page, before the code executes the next line

RecoScape is using the youtube home page, and does the excact samething bust this is dynmic, with every refresh something new data will be harvest.

this is the documentation used from.

https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html

note selenum of python need html to work, if a site does not use html, this will not work.

Thank you taking time and dedication
